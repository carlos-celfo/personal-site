          <h1>I'm Carlos Agelvis</h1>
          <p id="intro">
            I&apos;m a web developer and creative. I have deep interest in the
            making of new things, whether that be physical or digital, and feel
            deeply connected to the act itself: creation is what keeps us moving
            and growing.

            <h3>Sticky Notes App</h3>
            <h4>React</h4>
            <p>
              App that allows to write in post-it types of notes. It has the
              capacity to add new notes, delete notes that already exist and
              search for specific notes throught the search bar, doesn't matter
              if its in the title of the note or the description part. This
              project- which is part of the Skillcrush online course curricula-
              represented the first big project I did with React and in which I
              gained lots of experience about functional components and lifecyle
              methods, among other React tools.

            <h3>Guess the word Game</h3>
            <h4>JavaScript, HTML5 and CSS</h4>
            <p>
              Game app in which you need to find out which word is hiding behind
              placeholders (commonly known as "the hanged man"). With this app,
              I used an API with more than 100 words to show random words
              everytime the game is started, making the game more interesting.
              It recognizes also if the input typed by the user is not a string
              (for example a number or a symbol), or if the input value is
              already repeated. Besides, there's the possibility to play again,
              whether you loose or win. <br />Go and try it! Have fun!

            <h4>Javascript, HTML5 and CSS</h4>
            <p>
              App to show my repositories of github in a more simplistic and
              direct manner. It has the capacity to search an specific
              repository by their name, so it can be easy to find. an API in it
              brings the information from github to the app, both of my profile
              in the platform and also of all of the repositories I've made.
              Once you choose one project, one click in a button can redirect
              you the repo in the github page.</br> If you wanna know my work, I invite you to have a look at it!

              This is a special website, since it was my first one that is fully responsive and with different pages within, built with flexbox. this website is part of the Skillcrush curricula in order to learn responsive design. As such, is has the capacity to be seen in every screentype and be adapted to it- changing its size depending on the media query declared in the CSS. With this project, I learn to use the web developer tools and realize how useful it is in order to create awesome websites.

              I&apos;m a deeply energized person who likes to move and create:
              from dancing, to knitting, to designing in different ways.
            </p>
            <p>
              I like to take care of people and creating a bond with them makes
              me understand their thoughts and ideas better. I also like to be
              involved in society&apos;s progress and it fuels my vision in
              order to reflect that in my work. Communication is a big part of
              my daily life, communication avoids any setback and makes
              everything clear. I like to design with colorful and smooth ideas,
              which makes everything attractive and at the same time
              memorable.<br /><br />
              My commitment with these standards result in a web design that
              displays successfully my clients ideas with my design.
