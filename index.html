                <h1>Hi! I'm Carlos Agelvis</h1>
                    <p id="intro">I&apos;m a web developer and creative. I have deep interest in the  making of new things, 
                        whether that be physical or digital, and feel deeply connected to the act itself: 
                        creation is what keeps us moving and growing.

                    <p>
                      Web page for the food project Rogue Pickings, in which can be seen
                      everything about them with one simple look. Working with them was
                      an amazing experience, and by communication we were able to find
                      the perfect design for their project.<br/>
                      Rogue Pickings is about giving the freshness of the food to the
                      everyday worker, so the page had to be simple and intuitive, which
                      is something hard to find nowadays. The colors of the website also
                      match their spirit and vision.

                    <h3>Jubilee Austen Project</h3>
                    <p>
                      Web page for Jubilee Austen, in which displays her career as a web
                      developer. This is a professional website that at the same time
                      manages to transmit calming aura.<br />
                      Jubilee is a serene woman and as such, her website must reflect
                      that part that shines all over her vision of work: easy on the
                      eyes, soothing design and effective information. The website does
                      count with interactive items that also reflect the hard work made.

                    <p>
                      With the Recipe project, I wanted to create a web page that displays recipes with an engagement effect- 
                      what I desire is for the reader to be encouraged to do the recipe once it lays eyes on it.<br> 
                      Its made with different elements, like pictures showing the recipes, the time table and a list of ingredients. 
                      The work made in the back with the code was challenging, but with a great result. 
                      I already made the recipes myself because of this!

                    Communication is a big part of my daily life, communication avoids any setback and makes everything clear.
