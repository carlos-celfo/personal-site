                <h1>I'm Carlos Agelvis</h1>
                    <p id="intro">I&apos;m a web developer and creative. I have deep interest in the  making of new things, 
                        whether that be physical or digital, and feel deeply connected to the act itself: 
                        creation is what keeps us moving and growing.

                    <h4>HTML5, CSS (flexbox) and Github</h4>
                    <p>
                      This is a special website, since it was my first one that is fully responsive
                      and with different pages within. Unplugged retreat is about reconnecting with
                      your own self and with your colleagues from work, which sometimes they
                      can be hard to understand. They wanted a page that reflected deep forest colors
                      and vibes, and through big spaces and matching colors I was able to achieve that.

                    <p>
                      Web page for the food project Rogue Pickings, in which can be seen
                      everything about them with one simple look. Working with them was
                      an amazing experience, and by communication we were able to find
                      the perfect design for their project.<br/>
                      Rogue Pickings is about giving the freshness of the food to the
                      everyday worker, so the page had to be simple and intuitive, which
                      is something hard to find nowadays. The colors of the website also
                      match their spirit and vision.

                      Web page for Jubilee Austen, in which displays her career as a web
                      developer. This is a professional website that at the same time
                      manages to transmit calming aura.<br />
                      Jubilee is a serene woman and as such, her website must reflect
                      that part that shines all over her vision of work: easy on the
                      eyes, soothing design and effective information. The website does
                      count with interactive items that also reflect the hard work made.
